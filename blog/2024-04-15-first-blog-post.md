# Welcome to My First Post!

## Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Mathias Rodriguez. I am 30 years old and work in the technology sector. This field ignites my passion, making my job something I can enjoy every day. I love learning new things all the time. I am extremely grateful to join this new edition of the postgraduate program, EDFI (Especialización en Fabricación Digital e Innovación) dictated by UTEC Uruguay and Fab Lab Barcelona.

## My Journey in EDFI

As a student of EDFI, I am thrilled to embark on this journey where I will deepen my knowledge and skills in digital fabrication and innovation. This program is a perfect blend of theoretical knowledge and practical applications, providing a unique opportunity to work on hands-on projects and collaborate with peers.

## Future Plans for This Page

Over time, I plan to add and improve this page with more documentation and projects that I develop as part of my coursework and my own experiments. My goal is to share useful resources, insights, and experiences that might help others in their own technology endeavors.

## Stay Tuned!

Keep an eye on this space as I document my progress and learnings. I am excited about everything I will learn with you and look forward to making this page a valuable resource for fellow enthusiasts in the field of digital fabrication and innovation.

Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to reach out if you have questions or suggestions for future content!
